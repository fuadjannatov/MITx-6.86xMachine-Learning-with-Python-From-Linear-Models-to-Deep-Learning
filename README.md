### Completed projects from MITx 6.86xMachine Learning with Python-From Linear Models to Deep Learning course

https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to

 ## In this course, I learned about principles and algorithms for turning training data into effective automated predictions. We will cover:

1. Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC dimension;
2. Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning;
3. On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep learning.
